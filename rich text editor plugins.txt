2. Mention - How can mentioning persist after posting.

3. Hashtag - How can hashtags persist after posting.





Works perfectly:

1. Undo/Redo.

2. Emojis

3. inline toolbar - works - showing bold, italic, underline, header, numbered lists and unnumbered lists.
iniline toolbar issues - numbered and unnumbered lists don't show on the sides, when overflow y is set to auto, but it is not set to auto then the text doesn't remin within the bounderies of th editor.
 --I've cancaled the maximun height and aso the overflow setting. It's not optimal but it's not as worse as the alternative.

4. divider doesnt show up -- works like a charm. Had to add position relative to parent component
***After publishing it isn't visible at all

5. Anchor - anchor doesn't appear in inline toolbar. -- fixed, works perfectly

5. Linkify - links just turn into text after posting. Fuck linkify. anchor works instead
